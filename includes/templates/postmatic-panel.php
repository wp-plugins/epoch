<h1>Send new comment notifictions - <strong>and let them hit reply</strong>.</h1>

<p>Epoch is an amazing plugin that brings fantastic new technology to WordPress commenting - but it is only half the picture.</p>

<p>Add Postmatic to your site (it's free!) to enable two-way email comment notifications. Two way? Yes. The days of <em>notifications</em> are over. <strong>It's time to let them hit reply</strong>.</p>

<h2>Epoch + Postmatic</h2>
<p>When running Epoch along with Postmatic the magic really happens. The comment stream is updated in realtime with comments being posted from web as well as email. Subscribing to new comments is quick and simple while users are intelligently invited to become site subscribers as well. All without ugly checkboxes and obtrusive forms.</p>
