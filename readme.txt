Epoch - 100% realtime chat and commenting in a tiny little package that is fully CDN and cache compatible.

== Description ==

Epoch is a new plugin from the creators of [Postmatic](http://gopostmatic.com). The goal: To provide a realtime commenting/chat experience using fully native comments while being compatible with page caching, cdns, mobile, other comment plugins, and seo best practices. A tall order? For sure. Try it out.

Epoch provides an amazing commenting experience to your users **while improving site performance at the same time**.


= Epoch solves three big native commenting problems =

**User Experience**

Comment forms and display are often neglected by theme developers. We've been there ourselves. The functions and templates involved in WordPress commenting are complicated, frustrating, and no fun to work with. Every day we see fantastic themes with ridiculously poor commenting experiences. So that's the first thing Epoch fixes.

**Speed and context**

No more submitting comments and watching the page reload. All Epoch comments are submitted via ajax and post instantly in their proper place within the conversation.

And, as it should be, new comments from other users show up like magic automatically. It doesn't matter if they are posted from the web, or from email via [Postmatic](http://gopostmatic.com). The conversation is instantly updated.

**Cacheing, page load, and CDNs**

Epoch is hands down the fastest commenting system available for WordPress, all the while supporting page cacheing and CDNs. Epoch comments lazy load into a placeholder container only when needed. This means your post will load instantly, your comments will load instantly, and your server won't blink. And no, we don't use iframes. Your full SEO mojo is in tact.


= Success through compatibility =
Epoch is built for compatibility. Just like Postmatic. It uses fully native WordPress commenting, plays nicely with most all other commenting plugins, and employs WordPress coding standards. Use it with your favorite social login, voting, moderation, and other commenting plugins.

**Epoch is fully integrated with Postmatic**

When running Epoch along with [Postmatic](http://gopostmatic.com) the magic really happens. The comment stream is updated in realtime with comments being posted from web as well as email. Subscribing to new comments is quick and simple while users are intelligently invited to become site subscribers as well. All without ugly checkboxes and obtrusive forms.

**Want to jump into the ring and help with development?**

This is just 1.0. We're hoping the WordPress community will lend strength, ideas, and code to this project. That's why we've kept it open-source. You can find Epoch on Github and jump right in. We can't wait to see where commenting goes next.

= Combine Epoch with [Postmatic](http://gopostmatic.com) for the ultimate engagment package =

Postmatic is a free plugin which lets users subscribe to comments **but also reply right from their inbox by hitting reply**. Postmatic and Epoch integrate perfectly to let you take the conversation on the road and keep the conversation going months after you hit publish.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin through the WordPress Plugins Installer or upload `plugin-name.php` to the plugins directory of your content directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Epoch will then override the comment template that came with your theme. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Epoch override my native comments template? =

Only if you want it to. You can choose to style your comments using of our built in themes or use the comments template that is already in place on your site.

= Are comments displayed in ascending, or descending order? =

You choose. Epoch can go either way.

= Will Epoch kill my server with all of these ajax requests? =

Nope! Epoch is smarter than smart. No need to worry about that.
