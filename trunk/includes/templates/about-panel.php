<h1><span>Welcome to Epoch</span></h1>
<h2>Commenting Perfected<br /><small>A magical accompaniment by Postmatic</small></h2>
</div>

<p style="float:right;"><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic" target="_blank" class="button button-primary button-large">Get Postmatic. It's free!</a></p>
<h2>What does Epoch do and how does it work?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell: <strong>Epoch makes commenting fun again.</strong>. <em>Espcially when you combine it with <a href="http://gopostmatic.com">Postmatic</a> (it's free!).</em></p>
<div class="column">
<h3>Epoch makes commenting fun again</h3>
<p>Comment forms and display are often neglected by theme developers. The functions and templates involved in WordPress commenting are complicated, frustrating, and no fun to use. Every day we see fantastic themes with ridiculously poor commenting experiences. So that's the first thing Epoch fixes.</p>

<p><strong>Epoch is now overriding your native comment templates with a simple, elegant, and highly usable experience.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="column">
<h3>Is it commenting... or chat? It's hard to tell.</h3>
<p>No more submitting comments and watching the page reload. All Epoch comments are submitted via ajax and post instantly in their proper place within the conversation.</p>

<p>And, as it should be, new comments from other users show up like magic automatically. It doesn't matter if they are posted from the web, or from email via <a href="http://gopostmatic.com">Postmatic</a>. The conversation is instantly updated.</p>
</div>

<div class="column">
<h3>All with cacheing, CDN's and modern host support</h3>
<p>Epoch is hands down the fastest commenting system available for WordPress, all the while supporting page cacheing and CDNs. Epoch comments lazy load into a placeholder container only when needed. </p>
<p>This means your post will load instantly, your comments will load instantly, and your server won't blink. Comments are magically injected into your page so your full SEO mojo stays in tact.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="clear">Free Addons and Recommended Plugins</h2>
<p>Epoch is built for compatibility. Just like <a href="http://gopostmatic.com">Postmatic</a>. It uses fully native WordPress commenting, plays nicely with most all other commenting plugins, and employs WordPress coding standards. </p>

<div class="column">
<h4>Fight Spam</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since Epoch is fully WordPress native it plays well with your existing spam deterrents. It'll work seamlessly with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-spam/">WordPress Zero Spam</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-recaptcha/">WP-reCaptcha</a>, and <a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a>. That should take care of things.</p>
</div>

<div class="column">
<h4>Social Login</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Support for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-social-login/">WordPress Social Login</a> is built in and ready to go. Users can sign in with any of a dozen different social networks and services.</p>
</div>

<div class="column">
<h4>Add a toolbar</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let your commenters leave rich-text comments with beautiful simplicity. Epoch works out of the box with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-markdown/">WP-Markdown</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="clear">Contributors</h3>
<p>Epoch (we like to pronounce it 'epic') is a collaboration between <a href="http://gopostmatic.com">Postmatic</a> and <a href="http://calderawp.com">CalderaWP</a>. We knew WordPress commenting could be better. Together we made it happen. Need a hand with developing your own dream plugin? Check out <a href="https://calderawp.com/custom-plugin-development/">CalderaWP</a>.</p>

<p>This is just 1.0. We're hoping the WordPress community will lend strength, ideas, and code to this project. That's why we've kept it open-source. You can find <a href="http://github.com/postmatic/epoch" target="_blank">Epoch on Github</a> and jump right in. We can't wait to see where commenting goes next.</p>
